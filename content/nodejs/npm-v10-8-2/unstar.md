NAME
       npm-unstar - Remove an item from your favorite packages

   Synopsis
         npm unstar [<package-spec>...]

       Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

   Description
       "Unstarring" a package is the opposite of npm help star, it removes an item from your list of favorite packages.

   More
       There's also these extra commands to help you manage your favorite packages:

   Star
       You can "star" a package using npm help star

   Listing stars
       You can see all your starred packages using npm help stars

   Configuration
   registry
       •   Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"

       •   Type: URL

       The base URL of the npm registry.

   unicode
       •   Default: false on windows, true on mac/unix systems with a unicode locale, as defined by the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment variables.

       •   Type: Boolean

       When set to true, npm uses unicode characters in the tree output. When false, it uses ascii characters instead of unicode glyphs.

   otp
       •   Default: null

       •   Type: null or String

       This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed when publishing or changing package permissions with npm access.

       If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time password, npm will prompt on the command line for one.
