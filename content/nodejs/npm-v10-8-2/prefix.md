NPM-PREFIX(1)                                                                                                                                                                                         NPM-PREFIX(1)

NAME
       npm-prefix - Display prefix

   Synopsis
         npm prefix [-g]

       Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

   Description
       Print the local prefix to standard output. This is the closest parent directory to contain a package.json file or node_modules directory, unless -g is also specified.

       If -g is specified, this will be the value of the global prefix. See npm help config for more detail.

   Example
         npm prefix
         /usr/local/projects/foo

         npm prefix -g
         /usr/local

   Configuration
   global
       •   Default: false

       •   Type: Boolean

       Operates in "global" mode, so that packages are installed into the prefix folder instead of the current working directory. See npm help folders for more on the differences in behavior.

       •   packages are installed into the {prefix}/lib/node_modules folder, instead of the current working directory.

       •   bin files are linked to {prefix}/bin

       •   man pages are linked to {prefix}/share/man
