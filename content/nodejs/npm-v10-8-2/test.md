NAME
       npm-test - Test a package

   Synopsis
         npm test [-- <args>]

         aliases: tst, t

   Description
       This runs a predefined command specified in the "test" property of a package's "scripts" object.

   Example
         {
           "scripts": {
             "test": "node test.js"
           }
         }

         npm test
         > npm@x.x.x test
         > node test.js

         (test.js output would be here)

   Configuration
   ignore-scripts
       •   Default: false

       •   Type: Boolean

       If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package.json files.

       Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as npm start, npm stop, npm restart, npm test, and npm run-script will still run their intended script if ignore-scripts is set, but
       they will not run any pre- or post-scripts.

   script-shell
       •   Default: '/bin/sh' on POSIX systems, 'cmd.exe' on Windows

       •   Type: null or String

       The shell to use for scripts run with the npm exec, npm run and npm init <package-spec> commands.
