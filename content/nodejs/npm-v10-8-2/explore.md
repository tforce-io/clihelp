NAME
       npm-explore - Browse an installed package

   Synopsis
         npm explore <pkg> [ -- <command>]

       Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

   Description
       Spawn a subshell in the directory of the installed package specified.

       If a command is specified, then it is run in the subshell, which then immediately terminates.

       This is particularly handy in the case of git submodules in the node_modules folder:

         npm explore some-dependency -- git pull origin master

       Note that the package is not automatically rebuilt afterwards, so be sure to use npm rebuild <pkg> if you make any changes.

   Configuration
   shell
       •   Default: SHELL environment variable, or "bash" on Posix, or "cmd.exe" on Windows

       •   Type: String

       The shell to run for the npm explore command.
