NAME
       npm-root - Display npm root

   Synopsis
         npm root

       Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

   Description
       Print the effective node_modules folder to standard out.

       Useful for using npm in shell scripts that do things with the node_modules folder. For example:

         #!/bin/bash
         global_node_modules="$(npm root --global)"
         echo "Global packages installed in: ${global_node_modules}"

   Configuration
   global
       •   Default: false

       •   Type: Boolean

       Operates in "global" mode, so that packages are installed into the prefix folder instead of the current working directory. See npm help folders for more on the differences in behavior.

       •   packages are installed into the {prefix}/lib/node_modules folder, instead of the current working directory.

       •   bin files are linked to {prefix}/bin

       •   man pages are linked to {prefix}/share/man
