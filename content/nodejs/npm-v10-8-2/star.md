NAME
       npm-star - Mark your favorite packages

   Synopsis
         npm star [<package-spec>...]

       Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

   Description
       "Starring" a package means that you have some interest in it. It's a vaguely positive way to show that you care.

       It's a boolean thing. Starring repeatedly has no additional effect.

   More
       There's also these extra commands to help you manage your favorite packages:

   Unstar
       You can also "unstar" a package using npm help unstar

       "Unstarring" is the same thing, but in reverse.

   Listing stars
       You can see all your starred packages using npm help stars

   Configuration
   registry
       •   Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"

       •   Type: URL

       The base URL of the npm registry.

   unicode
       •   Default: false on windows, true on mac/unix systems with a unicode locale, as defined by the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment variables.

       •   Type: Boolean

       When set to true, npm uses unicode characters in the tree output. When false, it uses ascii characters instead of unicode glyphs.

   otp
       •   Default: null

       •   Type: null or String

       This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed when publishing or changing package permissions with npm access.

       If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time password, npm will prompt on the command line for one.
